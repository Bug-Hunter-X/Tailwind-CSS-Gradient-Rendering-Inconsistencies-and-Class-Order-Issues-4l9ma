```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality.  However, if the `to-purple-500` is omitted, or replaced with an invalid color, it may not produce the expected result in some browser environments, sometimes resulting in a blank or incorrectly rendered background.  Another issue arises if you nest `bg-gradient-*` classes with other background utilities like `bg-red-500` without understanding the order of operations. The last specified background utility will usually take precedence, sometimes unintentionally overriding the gradient.
